# Doubly Linked List Update with LLM Assistance

## Overview

This project focuses on updating a standard Linked List class to a Doubly Linked List, with the support of a Large Language Model (LLM). It is designed to help me practice interacting with AI tools to enhance my coding skills while preparing for a programming assignment at the end of the course.

## Project Outline

### 1. Introduction

- **Objective**: My goal is to update an existing Linked List class to a Doubly Linked List, using AI assistance to guide me through the process.
- **Focus**: Iâ€™m using this project to improve my LLM prompting skills while learning how to modify data structures effectively.

### 1.1 Importing Necessary Libraries

- I will begin by importing any essential libraries needed for the linked list operations.

### 2. The Node and LinkedList Classes to Update

- The core task is to modify the `Node` and `LinkedList` classes to add backward (previous) pointers, transforming the singly linked list into a doubly linked one.

### 3. Test Your Classes

- After updating the classes, I will create and run test cases to ensure that the doubly linked list works as expected.

### 4. Go Further with My LLM Prompting Skills

- This section encourages me to further improve my LLM interactions by extending the functionality of the Doubly Linked List or refining the code through additional prompts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/haseebraza715/Double_Linked_List-Assignement.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd Double_Linked_List-Assignement
   ```
3. Install any necessary libraries and begin working on the project.

## How I Use It

- I am using AI (LLMs) to assist in updating the Linked List class. Through prompts, I can generate code snippets and receive guidance for complex tasks.
- I will validate my solution by running the provided tests or creating my own.

## Future Work

- I plan to expand my understanding of data structures by applying the same techniques to more complex cases.
- Additional features like reverse traversal, sorting, or optimized memory management might be added in future iterations.
